# Table-Hockey-Game
‘Table Hockey’ is a two player game developed in C/C++. A table hockey game, also called board hockey, is a game for two players, derived from ice hockey. The game consists of a representation of a hockey rink; the players score goals by hitting a small puck into the opposing player’s space and the opponent fails to return it. 
	
**The proposed game consists of three levels.**
- Level 1 is cleared when one of the Player reaches the score 5. Each player is awarded 1 point for each goal.
- Level 2 is cleared when any one player reaches the score greater than 14. In this level, the speed of the ball is increased and each player is awarded 2 points for each goal.
- Level 3 is cleared and the winner is decided when any one player reaches the score greater than 30. In this level, an obstacle is added to increase the level of difficulty. Each player is awarded 3 points for each goal.
